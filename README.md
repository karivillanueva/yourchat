This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

The idea of this project is to show a small part of a chat system, the answers do not make logical sense and the project does not have an integrated login system, so the user is always the same and the logout is not functional.

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```bash

npm install

```

Then, configure the environment following the env.example and run the development server:

```bash

npm run dev

```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

Enjoy creating your chats!
